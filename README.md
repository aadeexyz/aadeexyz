# Hello World! I'm **Aadee**, currently living between _blocks_ and _chains_ 🌎⛓️

(I've tried to escape, but the blocks are just too interconnected.)

### Unhashed me 👷‍♂️
- 🔭 I’m currently working on blockchain projects that are more mysterious than the location of Satoshi Nakamoto. 🕵️‍♂️
- 🌱 I’m perpetually learning because, let's face it, blockchain changes more often than I drink coffee. And that's saying something. ☕️⏱️
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on... well, anything that doesn't involve debugging JavaScript at 3 am. 🌙
- 🤔 Seeking Assistance. If anyone has a spare quantum computer or a time machine, don't hesitate to hit me up! 🕰️🚀
- 💬 Ask me about my extensive collection of playing cards, it's more captivating than a royal flush! 🃏
- 📫 How to reach me: Send a carrier pigeon or, failing that, DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AadeeWasTaken). 🕊️
- ⚡ Fun fact: Once tried to create a blockchain using the Ligma programming language. You haven't heard of it? 🙃
